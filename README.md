## Who is Ryan?
Ryan (aka me) is a Marxist-Leninist, swiper, and a programmer with very little knowledge.
## Servers I'm affiliated with
- [Ryan's Library](https://discord.gg/QuWh5kdrKa) Learn about Marxism here.
- [SourcesDB](https://discord.gg/GfVKhMRK8U) Sources DB is the successor to the SGF Sources community. SGF Sources was a community that collected and shared learning material related to socialism, with a specific focus on Marxism. Sources DB expands its scope to any subject, including technology, medicine, biology, and more while still allowing social, political, and economic related material to be posted.
